**Overview**

This report contrasts two portfolios built using radically different approaches:  
- **Portfolio A** was created randomly based on letters from the author’s first name, with equal weights.  
- **Portfolio B** was constructed using fundamental screening and designed to mirror the sectoral composition of the S&P 500.  

The analysis includes the **Markowitz efficient frontier**, **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** estimates, and key performance ratios.  
All modeling was done in **Excel** and supplemented by tools like **Portfolio Visualizer** to simulate real-market behavior.

**Key Findings**

- **Portfolio A**, despite its random design, outperformed with a **15.84% return** and a **Sharpe ratio of 2.31**, beating the S&P 500’s Sharpe of 2.03.  
- **Portfolio B**, though grounded in solid logic, yielded only **7.08%** with higher volatility and a lower Sharpe ratio (0.86).  
- The results highlight the paradox that **randomized strategies can outperform theory-based ones in the short run** due to market anomalies.  
- However, Portfolio B’s sectoral diversification and fundamental grounding may offer more **long-term resilience**.

**Overview**

This report provides a structured overview of Bitcoin, starting with the 2008 white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto.  

It explains the **underlying blockchain architecture**, **Proof-of-Work protocol**, **mining incentives**, and the controlled monetary supply via the **halving mechanism**.  

The analysis blends technical insight with monetary theory, drawing on academic research and real-world economic observations.

**Key Findings**

- Bitcoin replaces institutional trust with cryptographic proof, decentralizing the concept of money.  
- The fixed supply and programmed halving events create a perception of digital scarcity, fueling speculative demand.  
- Despite its potential as a store of value, Bitcoin suffers from **high volatility**, **energy inefficiency**, and **limited transactional use**.  
- Its rigid protocol design may hinder scalability and adaptability in broader economic systems.

**Overview**

This report explores how blockchain technology can transform the insurance industry.

It introduces the **technical foundations of blockchain**, then dives into real applications such as **smart contracts**, **automated claims processing**, and **secure data sharing** between insurers.  

The study draws from industry reports (e.g., AXA, Lemonade) and academic research to assess operational benefits and future prospects.

**Key Findings**

- Blockchain enables **faster, more transparent claims settlement** via automated smart contracts.  
- **Secure inter-company data exchange** can help reduce fraud while ensuring customer confidentiality.  
- Adoption is still limited due to **regulatory uncertainty**, **legacy systems**, and **interoperability challenges**.  
- Pilot projects, especially in Europe, show strong potential in areas like **parametric insurance** and **microinsurance**, where automation adds real value.
