**Overview**

This report assesses the intrinsic value of **Dollarama Inc.** using both **absolute valuation models** (Gordon Growth Model, Residual Income) and **relative valuation** through industry multiples. 

The analysis uses financial data from 2017 to 2021, with growth, margin, and ROE assumptions grounded in historical performance. The **CAPM** was used to estimate the cost of equity, and all modeling was conducted in **Excel** to ensure transparency and auditability.

**Key Findings**

- The **Gordon Growth Model** produced a fair value of **$95.90**, closely matching the market price of **$95.35**.  
- The **Residual Income Model**, incorporating a 9% growth rate and ROE above the cost of equity, estimated a value of **$121.13**, suggesting **undervaluation**.  
- Relative valuation using P/E, P/B, and EV/EBITDA multiples confirmed Dollarama’s pricing as **reasonable within its peer group**.  
- While growth prospects remain strong, much of the upside appears **priced in**, leaving the stock **sensitive to macro shocks or regulatory changes**.
