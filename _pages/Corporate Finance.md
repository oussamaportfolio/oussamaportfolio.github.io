- Strategic complementarity: Dollarama gains U.S. exposure while Five Below partners with a financially stable global player.  
- Five Below is valued around **$7.5B USD** using DCF, with an EV/EBITDA multiple of **9.4×**, indicating a fair valuation.

**Overview**

This report compares the capital structure of six companies from different sectors by analyzing their debt ratios, cost of capital (WACC), and volatility.  

The study integrates theoretical frameworks such as **Modigliani & Miller**, **trade-off theory**, and **pecking order theory**.  
All data collection, financial analysis, and modeling were conducted using **Excel**, including simplified DCF valuations, beta estimation, and capital cost breakdowns.

**Key Findings**

- Firms with higher business risk (e.g., tech or energy sectors) tend to maintain lower leverage, aligning with financial theory.  
- More stable sectors (e.g., utilities or consumer staples) carry higher levels of debt due to predictable cash flows.  
- WACC differences were driven more by market-based risk perception than by pure capital structure.  
- Theoretical optimal structures often diverged from actual observed leverage, suggesting a strong influence from managerial preferences, taxation, and firm-specific constraints.

**Overview**

This report analyzes Imperial Oil’s shareholder distribution policy by examining historical dividend payments, share repurchase activity, and free cash flow generation. 

Using **financial statement analysis** and **FCFE-based payout ratios**, the report evaluates the sustainability and strategic rationale of Imperial’s capital return practices. The work is grounded in financial theory, including **signaling theory** and **Miller & Modigliani’s dividend irrelevance framework**.

**Key Findings**

- Dividends have grown steadily over the past decade, even through downturns like 2020, signaling strong financial discipline.  
- Share repurchase programs are cyclical, peaking in strong commodity cycles (e.g., **$1.3B in 2023**) and adjusted downward in weaker years.  
- Payout ratios based on FCFE mostly remain below 100%, supporting the view that distributions are sustainable.  
- Combined dividends and buybacks offer shareholders an attractive total yield while preserving the firm’s financial flexibility.
