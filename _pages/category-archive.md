Finance professional with a passion for investments, trading, and financial markets. With a bachelor's in finance and a master’s underway, I’ve built expertise in advising on mutual funds, fixed-term investments, and navigating complex markets.

Having passed CFA Level 1, I will be sitting for Level 2 in August, complementing my recent internship where I gained hands-on experience in the asset management world. As part of my journey, I’m seeking an internship this fall to officially complete my master's program. I'm excited to contribute to meaningful projects, and further grow in the dynamic world of finance.
