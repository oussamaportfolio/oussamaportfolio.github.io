**Overview**  

This internship report presents the experience gained within the **Real Estate team at PSP Investments**, one of Canada’s largest pension funds. It focuses on the **collection, validation, and consolidation of financial data** related to real estate investments held through complex partnership structures.

The report highlights the **operational constraints** faced by institutional investors, including heterogeneous data formats, reliance on external partners, reporting delays, and the heavy use of manual processes. Based on concrete on-the-ground observations, the analysis develops a critical reflection on the **potential role of artificial intelligence** in improving operational efficiency, while acknowledging the **governance, reliability, and fiduciary constraints** specific to pension fund management.

The study combines **professional practice**, the use of **industry-standard tools** (Excel, reporting platforms, internal databases), and insights from the **academic literature** on finance, data governance, and information systems.

**Key Results**

- Institutional real estate reporting still relies heavily on **manual processes**, despite the scale of assets under management and the financial sophistication of investment structures.
- **Data quality and availability** are highly dependent on external partners, creating operational risks, delays, and information asymmetries.
- Existing tools enable effective consolidation but reach their limits when confronted with the **complexity of real estate structures** and the frequency of required adjustments.
- Artificial intelligence offers **significant automation potential** (consistency checks, anomaly detection, standardization), but its deployment is constrained by **governance, auditability, and fiduciary responsibility** requirements.
- This internship experience clearly illustrates the gap between **financial theory** taught in academic programs and the **operational realities** of large institutional investors, emphasizing the need for a pragmatic and incremental approach to technological innovation.
