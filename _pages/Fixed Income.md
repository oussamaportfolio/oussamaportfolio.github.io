**Overview**

This project is divided into three interconnected parts:

- macroeconomic analysis of Brazil  
- JPY/BRL carry trade strategy (raw and filtered)  
- dynamic yield curve positioning based on interest rate expectations  

All calculations, filters, and performance evaluations were performed using advanced **Excel models**. These included annualized return computations, Sharpe ratios, skewness analysis, and simulation of interest rate shocks to assess optimal trade timing.

**Key Findings**

- The **raw JPY/BRL carry trade** produced modest returns (**5.92% annually**) with high volatility and poor risk-adjusted performance.  
- A simple macro filter (VIX < 20, inflation < 6%, rate differential > 2%) raised annual returns to **10.8%** and improved the Sharpe ratio to **0.75**.  
- A more advanced filter using **industrial production growth** delivered a Sharpe of **1.42** with annualized returns of **21%**.  
- Yield curve positioning in Brazil suggested **shorting 10Y bonds**, given persistent inflation pressures and expected rate hikes.  
- Together, the three components provided a **cohesive framework for international fixed income strategies** grounded in macro and market dynamics.
