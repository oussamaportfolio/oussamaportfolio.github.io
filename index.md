<div style="text-align: justify;">
Not your typical finance portfolio. Iâ€™m not here to impress with buzzwords or perfect credentials. Iâ€™m here because I care deeply about this field, and Iâ€™m doing everything I can to build a future in it, one step at a time.

## Who am I ? (My personal story)

<div style="text-align: justify;">
My passion for finance isnâ€™t theoretical â€” it started in the real world. In March 2020, while markets were collapsing, I turned a $2,500 trading account into over $8,000 in exactly 8 days. You can call it luck, timing, intuition â€” maybe it was all of that. But for me, it was a spark.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
Since then, Iâ€™ve kept trading in the background â€” mostly indices and commodities. But I knew I needed more than instinct. So I went back to school to learn more.

## What Iâ€™m Doing Now

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Iâ€™m a finance student in Montreal trying to break into the finance world. Itâ€™s competitive. Itâ€™s overwhelming. But Iâ€™m not here because itâ€™s easy. Iâ€™m here because I believe I can add value, and Iâ€™m willing to put in the work to prove it.
</div>

<br>

Iâ€™ve passed CFA Level I [(See Scores)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bPkyZEJnayXnovZHbgEy9aikAhfsgdnb/view?usp=sharing) and Iâ€™m preparing for Level II this August.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
Iâ€™ve done an internship at Intact Investment Management, where I worked on portfolio operations and data analysis. Iâ€™ve built models during my graduate. Iâ€™ve dug through real investment problems. And Iâ€™ve made mistakes â€” but I'm always willing to learn.
</div>

<br>

Iâ€™m learning everything I can:

- Portfolio theory, risk models, valuation  
- Options, derivatives, macro strategies  
- Python, MATLAB, SQL  

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Iâ€™ve also realized that finance is much bigger than trading and Iâ€™m now exploring investment banking, corporate finance, and research. I donâ€™t have one fixed path. I just want to learn, to grow, and to contribute.

## Why this site exists

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Every project here reflects something I was curious about, struggled with, and learned from. Whether itâ€™s:
</div>

- Modeling a portfolioâ€™s risk exposures  
- Running simulations for option pricing  
- Writing Python code that actually works after hours of debugging  

<div style="text-align: justify;">
â€¦It all matters to me. And I hope it matters to someone reading this too.
</div>

## Letâ€™s Talk

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Iâ€™m looking for an internship this fall to complete my Masterâ€™s. But more than that, Iâ€™m looking for a shot â€” a place to keep learning, to contribute, and to be part of something real.
