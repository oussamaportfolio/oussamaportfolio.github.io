This site isn’t flashy. It’s not built to impress anyone. It’s just my way of saying: “Here’s what I’ve worked on. Here’s what I care about. And here’s where I’m trying to go.”

## Who am I ? (My personal story)

My passion for finance isn’t theoretical — it started in the real world. In March 2020, while markets were collapsing, I turned a $2,500 trading account into over $8,000 in exactly 8 days. You can call it luck, timing, intuition — maybe it was all of that. But for me, it was a spark.

Since then, I’ve kept trading in the background — mostly indices and commodities. But I knew I needed more than instinct. So I went back to school to learn more. I’m a finance student in Montreal trying to break into the finance world. It’s competitive. It’s overwhelming. But I’m not here because it’s easy. I’m here because I believe I can add value, and I’m willing to put in the work to prove it.

I’ve passed CFA Level 1 and I’m preparing for Level 2 this August. I’ve done an internship at Intact Investment Management, where I worked on portfolio operations and data analysis. I’ve built models during my graduate. I’ve dug through real investment problems. And I’ve made mistakes — but I'm alwys willing to learn.
  
- Interests: Portfolio optimization, derivatives, quantitative models, corporate finance 
- Tools: Office suite, Python, MATLAB, Excel

## Why this site exists

Every project here reflects something I was curious about, struggled with, and learned from. Whether it’s:

- Modeling a portfolio’s risk exposures  
- Running simulations for option pricing  
- Writing Python code that actually works after hours of debugging  

…It all matters to me. And I hope it matters to someone reading this too.

## Let’s Talk

I’m looking for an internship this fall to complete my Master’s. But more than that, I’m looking for a shot — a place to keep learning, to contribute, and to be part of something real.
